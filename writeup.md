What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
- I feel like the biggest challenge is finding out the mindmap of designing the whole project, where to start, how to implement, and where to end. Moreover, I find some tasks quite challenging, such as editing posts, and building the suer info databases.
Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make
- Definitely polishing my website. Right now it lacks visual effects. Additionally, as what is mentioned in the extra credit, e.g. password encryption, image status uppdates, these are something that could be improved if given more time.
What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
- A lot, such as post ownership, real-time updates, single user role, etc.. Most assumptions are useful and essential for completing this project.
How long did this assignment take to complete?
- About three days.
